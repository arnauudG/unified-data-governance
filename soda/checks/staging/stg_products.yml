# STAGING Layer - Products Table Quality Checks
# Database: SODA_CERTIFICATION, Schema: STAGING
# Table: stg_products (1,000+ records)
# 
# DECISION: "Is the transformation successful and can we proceed to MART?"
# RISK: Bad transformations, inconsistent data, missing required fields for downstream
# QUALITY DIMENSIONS: Schema, Validity (transformation rules), Completeness (for downstream joins), Consistency
